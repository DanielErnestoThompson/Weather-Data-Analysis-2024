# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to generate and analyze a synthetic dataset of daily weather observations. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib in a Google Colab environment, the project creates a year's worth of weather data, analyzes it, and visualizes the temperature trends over time.

## Data Generation
The script `generate_weather_data(num_days)` creates random weather data for a specified number of days. It generates:

- Dates for the given number of days.
- Random temperature values between -10 and 35 degrees Celsius.
- Random precipitation levels between 0 and 10 mm.

This data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame with columns for the date, temperature, and precipitation.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is intentionally injected with some missing values to simulate real-world data imperfections. These missing values are then filled using a forward-fill method to maintain data integrity for analysis.

## Data Analysis
Basic statistical analysis is performed on the dataset to provide insights into the temperature and precipitation over the selected period. This includes count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values.

## Visualization
A line plot is generated to visualize the temperature trends over time, providing a clear and intuitive understanding of the data.

## Data Storage
The generated data is saved as a CSV file in a specified directory within Google Drive, ensuring that the data is easily accessible for further analysis or sharing.

## Usage
To use this project:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the script to generate the weather data.
3. View the statistical summary and the temperature trend plot.
4. The generated data is automatically saved to your Google Drive in the specified directory.

This project provides a template for weather data analysis that can be expanded or modified to suit different analytical needs or to work with real-world data.
